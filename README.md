Hello this is Reagan Liu. I am new learner in this class and interested in learning how to program for iOs apps. Since apple programming is a niche community, iOS programming is fundamental to learning how to create apps. My hobbies include exercising, learning new things include mobile application programming. Mobile application programming can be beneficial as it can improve the users experience with various features.
